# Falcon
A Swift iOS app to look back at SpaceX launches &amp; landings, with an option to follow them live.

This project was originally started for me to learn (as a student), but put on GitHub with the goal to eventually launch the app.

# Features that are in already
- An overview of launches / landings / other with data about dates, patch, rocket, launch-site, payload, YouTube links (launches/landings) and short descriptions.
- 'Live' tab with only a WebView to a website.

# Features that are in, but very poorly
- Add new launches by fetching them from somewhere (currently parsing from HTML, a real database is needed).
- Abbreviations (are in but not all important ones, will have to be categorized, maybe even searchable).
- Lots of other things.

# New features that will have to be implemented
- An overview of landings, very similar to the launches.
- Link info about cores so that users can look up all launches of one specific core.
- Push notifications (remote) to let users follow live.
- More...

# More info
The data in the app right now is not up to date.
